For Humanity — A Letter from CEO Brian Weaver
MARCH 10, 2023
The idea for Torch.AI was born from great difficulty.  The first versions of our software helped clients like Microsoft, GE, and Deloitte analyze vast amounts of information to make better decisions.  The experience was awful.

While the software worked as advertised, the trouble could be summarized by a highly technical term: garbage in, garbage out.  Raw data was generally so difficult to work with that we (or our customers) had no other option but to hire an army of people to try and keep up.  I saw this messy data problem at nearly every organization I encountered, that’s when the light bulb went on.

Data is growing exponentially.  You are creating nearly 2 megabytes of data per second and that will grow by 300% over just the next few years.  Most jobs today involve working with more and more information.  The challenge is that about 90% of this information is in formats that are just too hard to use, for either human or machine.  To make matters worse, today’s technology exacerbates the problem by replicating data: the average enterprise makes 9 digital copies of things like personnel records, customer data, and sensitive corporate information.

This data deluge and technology sprawl has resulted in a degradation of humanity.  Society is less happy.  Workers toil in mundane jobs swiveling between screens patching gaps in technology, transcribing information from system to system. Jobs are getting harder as a result and risks are increasing in magnitude and frequency.

 

It doesn’t have to be this way.

 

Torch.AI invented software that instantly makes your data totally available, usable, and valuable.  Our now patented method of processing data will change your job for the better.  And we think it has the potential to make our world a better place.

 

We have the awesome privilege to use our technology to solve problems for our country, improving national security and enhancing our economic viability.  Transforming US military capabilities with advanced technologies like our core platforms: Nexus, Prism, and Halo, allow our customers and partners to make decisions at the speed of information.  As a defense focused artificial intelligence company, we proactively and preemptively invest in R&D to make deployable solutions to some of the world’s hardest problems ready today.

Some of the brightest engineers and technologists work at Torch.AI and they are on a mission. If you are a pioneer that wants to help change the world, we’d love to meet.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? They build systems that make data eassier to use. Torch.ai software makes data totally available, usable, and valuable.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Torch.AI is a defense focused AI-software company. Unlike traditional government contractors, our team of experts takes calculated risks to self-fund R&D behind the scenes and then sells complete products "off-the-shelf" to mission owners. We conduct deep research into understanding how AI and new data infrastructures can improve a growing array of national defense needs. This allows us to go from ideation to full capability deployment in weeks and months, instead of years.
