* <span style="color:grey">How did the idea for the company come about? </span>

> A Letter from Torch.ai CEO Brian Weaver For Humanity March 10, 2023 ([Torch.ai Website](https://www.torch.ai/)):
>
> The idea for Torch.AI was born from great difficulty.  The first versions of our software helped clients like Microsoft, GE, and Deloitte analyze vast amounts of information to make better decisions.  The experience was awful.
>
> While the software worked as advertised, the trouble could be summarized by a highly technical term: garbage in, garbage out.  Raw data was generally so difficult to work with that we (or our customers) had no other option but to hire an army of people to try and keep up.  I saw this messy data problem at nearly every organization I encountered, that’s when the light bulb went on.
>
> Data is growing exponentially.  You are creating nearly 2 megabytes of data per second and that will grow by 300% over just the next few years.  Most jobs today involve working with more and more information.  The challenge is that about 90% of this information is in formats that are just too hard to use, for either human or machine.  To make matters worse, today’s technology exacerbates the problem by replicating data: the average enterprise makes 9 digital copies of things like personnel records, customer data, and sensitive corporate information.
>
> This data deluge and technology sprawl has resulted in a degradation of humanity.  Society is less happy.  Workers toil in mundane jobs swiveling between screens patching gaps in technology, transcribing information from system to system. Jobs are getting harder as a result and risks are increasing in magnitude and frequency.
>
> It doesn’t have to be this way.
>
> Torch.AI invented software that instantly makes your data totally available, usable, and valuable.  Our now patented method of processing data will change your job for the better.  And we think it has the potential to make our world a better place.
>
>We have the awesome privilege to use our technology to solve problems for our country, improving national security and enhancing our economic viability.  Transforming US military capabilities with advanced technologies like our core platforms: Nexus, Prism, and Halo, allow our customers and partners to make decisions at the speed of information.  As a defense focused artificial intelligence company, we proactively and preemptively invest in R&D to make deployable solutions to some of the world’s hardest problems ready today.
>
> Some of the brightest engineers and technologists work at Torch.AI and they are on a mission. If you are a pioneer that wants to help change the world, we’d love to meet.

## Recommendations

* <span style="color:grey">If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? </span>
> Offer an AI Governance product (framework) and service that integrates with their products in response to growing demand for ethical AI.
> ```Artificial intelligence governance is the legal framework for ensuring AI and machine learning technologies are researched and developed with the goal of helping humanity adopt and use these systems in ethical and responsible ways. (source Holistic AI)```

* <span style="color:grey">Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? ([IBM-AI Governance](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-governance#Why+is+AI+governance+important%3F))</style>
> ```AI governance is essential for reaching a state of compliance, trust and efficiency in developing and applying AI technologies. With AI's increasing integration into organizational and governmental operations, its potential for negative impact has become more visible. High-profile missteps like the Tay chatbot incident, where a Microsoft AI chatbot learned toxic behavior from public interactions on social media and the COMPAS software's biased sentencing decisions have highlighted the need for sound governance to prevent harm and maintain public trust.```

* <span style="color:grey">What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? ([Holistic AI](https://www.holisticai.com/blog/ai-governance)) </span>
>```Implementing AI governance in an organisation requires a systematic approach. It begins with familiarising oneself with all relevant ethical principles, legal requirements, and industry guidelines.```
> ```Next, organisations should assess – or commission an independent third-party to assess – their existing AI systems, data practices, and policies. This way, they can identify any gaps or areas for improvement.```
>```Lastly, establishing monitoring mechanisms and conducting regular audits is crucial. This facilitates the assessment of the effectiveness of your AI governance practices.```

* <span style="color:grey">Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? </span>

The products offered by Torch.ai are very complex.  Proper Governance of these products will require a deep understanding of both how these products were built as well as a strong understanding of Governance frameworks.
